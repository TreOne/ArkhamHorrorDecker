     </strong>
     <span class="icon-action">
     </span>
     A reliable weapon that sets the standard in cost and efficiency for all weapons. The +1 Damage bonus it gives during combat is absolutely essential in order to defeat enemies in one turn. Unfortunately, it is limited to 4 uses, so make good use of them.

      </a>
     </strong>
     , still provides a +1 Damage bonus and is
     <u>
      NOT
     </u>
     limited to 4 uses. The drawback is that the +1 Damage bonus is lost if you are engaging more than just one enemy, but you can overcome this easily by defeating enemies as they spawn, and/or by having your co-op partner help you with engaging enemies strategically.

     </strong>
     <span class="icon-action">
     </span>
     A great Event that you can play when looking for a specific weapon from your deck, or just a weapon in general. Will be even better if you decide to upgrade into a
     <strong>
      <a href="/card/02301">
       Lightning Gun

     later, as it will essentially let you draw it whenever you need it.
    </p>

  </ul>
  <p>
   Since this deck is so focused on combat, it also includes a couple of Events and Skills that will help out a lot when fighting enemies
  </p>
  <ul>

     <strong>
      2x

     <span class="icon-action">
     </span>
     <em>
      Fast
     </em>
     Event you can use to cancel an attack from particularly nasty enemy. Can be used on your co-op partner if you are in the same location, during his own turn. Very useful when facing attacks that deal high amounts of Horror.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <strong>
      2x
      <a href="/card/01025">
       Vicious Blow

     <span class="icon-action">
     </span>
     Skill you can commit during a
     <span class="icon-combat">
     </span>
     test when fighting an enemy, to raise your chances of passing it and then deal +1 Damage. Allows you to deal 2 Damage to an enemy without using a weapon, or even deal a whopping 3 Damage (or more) to an enemy when using a weapon.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Sometimes you'll find yourself in a situation where no enemies are around, which means that you won't be able to discover clues using

     A very interesting Event that will help both you and your co-op partner recover Sanity after defeating an enemy (if you are at the same location). At worst, the card will make you recover 1 Sanity and at best, both your partner and you will recover 2 Sanity.

   is a very straightforward investigator to play, and the general strategy of this deck is

  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     At the start of a Scenario, assuming you have a good starting hand, the first actions to take should generally be equipping one or two Assets, ideally a weapon, and then moving towards a location with clues.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     If you did not draw a weapon even after Mulliganing, prioritise drawing one rather than moving.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     If you did not draw a weapon but did draw a
     <strong>
      <a href="/card/02184">
       Prepared for the Worst
      </a>
     </strong>
     Event, then you can use it on your first turn to look for one. Otherwise, it's best to keep it in order to draw a specific weapon at a specific time, like
     <strong>
      <span class="icon-unique">
      </span>
      <a href="/card/01006">

     </strong>
     , or even the
     <strong>
      <a href="/card/02301">

      </a>
     </strong>
     if you decided to upgrade into it.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Always try to end your turn on a location with clues, ideally one with a high Shroud value, with the hope of drawing an enemy from the Encounter deck. That way, you'll be able to defeat the enemy using your weapon, and discover a clue thanks to

  </p>
  <ul>

     to investigate locations with a Shroud of 2 or less, you will
     <u>
      ALWAYS
     </u>
     succeed unless you draw the

   Manage your resources carefully, try not to go down to zero so you can still play

     Event in advance.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Gaining a resource should generally be the lowest priority action, so only do it when there is nothing else to do, or if you are planning on playing a costly card the next turn.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Drawing a card is generally not as good as moving, fighting or investigating, but it's generally better than gaining a resource.

     If you ever need to draw a card, make sure it is the first action of your turn.

     action remaining after the move is done, never 0, and never more than 1. This is because some locations have
     <em>

All in all, an OK card which might surprise you from time to time, and since it does not need to be drawn, paid for or played, it's better to have it in the deck with the options it brings than not.

   <strong>
    no story spoilers
   </strong>
   , which includes not saying much about victory conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="icon-fast">

  <h3>
   <strong>
    Extracurricular Activity
   </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
   In this Scenario, the Encounter deck is heavily focused on making you discard as many cards as possible from your deck, which is a big problem since you can't win if all your powerful cards are thrown in the discard pile before you can even use them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Scenario is also quite combat focused, and features powerful enemies with high Health and Fight values, as well as a very tough end Boss. Not only that, you'll be tasked to discover a significant amount of clues from locations with high Shroud values and/or tricky
   <strong>
    Forced
   </strong>
   effects, in order to progress.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, I suggest equipping a weapon as fast as possible before they get discarded, preferably a
   <strong>
    <a href="/card/01020">
     Machete
    </a>
   </strong>
   so it won't run out of charges, and ideally also equipping a
   <strong>
    <a href="/card/01087">
     Flashlight
    </a>
   </strong>
   , or have a hand of cards that help you discover clues.

   <strong>
    The House Always Wins
   </strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
   This Scenario features a departure from the established gameplay norms, as it is much more focused on interacting with locations rather than combat, even though it will be unavoidable at some point.
  </p>
  <p>
   You'll be moving from location to location and discovering clues according to every location's special ability, while also avoiding arousing suspicion from the enemies which start off
   <em>
    Aloof
   </em>
   , meaning, will not automatically engage you.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, interact with the different locations as fast as possible to discover the clues, while also avoiding to provoke the enemies following you around, because it is possible to make them aggressive if you're not careful, which would make the Agenda deck advance faster than it should.

   This Scenario is also a bit different from the others, as instead of having multiple enemies in the Encounter deck,  it only features one single enemy which will keep coming back after you defeat it, a little bit stronger each time. The main emphasis is still clue gathering, however, and the Scenario features multiple locations with high Shroud values and tough
   <strong>
    Forced
   </strong>
   effects to slow you down.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are two different ways to move from the first location to the second, and taking one or the other will also slightly change your gameplay experience throughout the Scenario. The first one will have you gather clues from a location with a high Shroud value, and the second will have you succeed one VERY tough
   <span class="icon-combat">
   </span>
   test. You should, therefore, keep in mind which way you want to go when you are mulliganing your starting hand.
  </p>
  <p>
   You are going to want to finish the Scenario as quickly as possible, as the one enemy that keeps coming back will get bigger and bigger until you will no longer be able to deal with it. It starts out small enough, so starting out with a weapon is still recommended.

   The most important thing to know when playing this Scenario is that you will be only able to move to the next location,
   <u>
    AFTER
   </u>
   discovering all the clues from your current locations. What you are going to focus on, is moving from location to location as quickly as possible, so discovering clues as fast as possible. You are going to be on a death-clock through the whole Scenario, as every time the Agenda deck advances, the leftmost locations are going to get removed from play. You obviously don't want to be there when it happens.
  </p>
  <p>
   What is more, every location you will move to has a nasty
   <strong>
    Forced
   </strong>
   effect, and Doom will stack up quickly if you are unlucky with the Encounter deck. Also,
   <strong>
    Revelation
   </strong>
   effects and enemies from the Encounter deck are mostly based on trying to stop you from moving as much as possible, so
   <u>
    GET MOVING

  <p>
   You might also draw
   <strong>
    <a href="/card/02179">

   s from the Encounter deck which can be annoying, but if you equip your allies on the side, you will end the Scenario before they become a problem.

   Assets in play are at risk of getting removed and/or neutralised by cards from the Encounter deck, so mind when you play them.

  </p>
  <p>
   I suggest keeping your most powerful clue gathering cards for the very end of the Scenario, so while you are getting there, do not by wasteful when discovering clues.

   In this Scenario, you will be hunting a certain number of big and tough enemies that can only be damaged by a special Story Asset, which you will obtain in the Scenario. The better you did in the previous Scenario, the tougher this one will be because you will have more of those enemies to defeat.
  </p>
  <p>
   A lot of people dislike this one because of its overreliance on the
   <span class="icon-willpower">
   </span>
   stat, since you will need to succeed very tough
   <span class="icon-willpower">
   </span>
   tests in order to damage the beasties. With Roland's 3
   <span class="icon-willpower">
   </span>
   , it is going to be pretty tough.
  </p>
  <p>
   The good news is that you do not need to defeat all the big baddies, only as many as you can, which is exactly how you will want to play the Scenario. Defeating all of the (if you did really well in the previous Scenario) is going to be
   <u>
    VERY

   difficult, so

  <h3>
   <strong>
    Where Doom Awaits
   </strong>

  <p>
   This Scenario is a race against the clock, as
   <strong>
    failing it will end your Campaign
   </strong>
   . You will be trying to get to the top of a hill, with the Encounter deck and locations doing everything in their power to slow you down. You will have a total of 22 turns to win before the Scenario ends, and for every Story enemy you let escape in the previous Scenario, you will lose 1 turn. I have still managed to win with 3 escaped enemies, so it is not that handicapping.
  </p>
  <p>
   There will be a main path to climb, with divergent paths to explore in order to get the clues will you need to advance. The locations you will have to investigate how varying Shroud values, but their
   <strong>
    Forced
   </strong>
   effects can really hurt you if you are not careful.
  </p>
  <p>
   The scenario is investigation heavy since you will be trying to get clues as fast as possible, so keep your
   <strong>
    <a href="/card/01087">

   Some Encounter cards will hit you if you are on the main path and others if you are on divergent paths, but the latter are much worst than the former. I recommend spending as little time as possible on the divergent paths, so just grab your clues and get back on the main path.

   This Scenario's quirk is that locations will be coming into play from the Encounter deck, instead of any other previously encountered location source. They will come into play with tough

  </p>
  <p>
   It will be quite tough on your Sanity, so I do suggest already having upgraded into an
   <strong>

  <ul>
   <li>
    A co-op partner would be able to commit cards to your
    <span class="icon-willpower">
    </span>
    tests, giving you better chances to pass them. They could also be the ones drawing those nasty Encounters cards that test
    <span class="icon-willpower">
    </span>
    instead of you, either by luck or by using cards like
    <strong>
     <a href="/card/01061">
      Scrying

  <p>
   The same principle applies with
   <strong>
    <a href="/card/01007">
     Cover Up
    </a>
   </strong>
   , in some Scenarios, you might not see it at all or draw it from the very beginning, but other times you might get
   <u>
    REALLY
   </u>
   unlucky and draw it at the very end of the Scenario, which is almost impossible to counter
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Having a co-op partner to help you deal with the weakness whenever it pops up, will significantly lower the chances of you stacking up Mental Trauma caused by bad luck when drawing across the Scenarios.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <span class="icon-fast">
   </span>
   In short, while being a great deck even when played solo, it is more consistent with a partner to have your back when it comes to mitigating your weaknesses (
   <span class="icon-willpower">
   </span>
   tests and
   <strong>
    <a href="/card/01007">
     Cover Up

   </strong>
   ) and unpredictable bad drawing luck that comes with deck building card games.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="icon-fast">
   </span>
   When playing solo, it becomes essential to know what a Scenario brings so you can adapt to it, keep that in mind! Check out the

   Depending on the Scenario, your co-op partner(s), or your own preference, it is possible to shift the deck's focus by switching a few cards while still keeping the same feel. You can also do it in between Scenarios, if you want to "tech" up to counter specific situations.

     I cut it from the deck because it serves the same purpose as Roland's

     So far I've never had any problems with the Hand Slots, as most of the Hand Assets run out of charges and are OK to replace. It might look more useful after upgrading into a
     <strong>
      <a href="/card/02301">
       Lightning Gun
      </a>
     </strong>
     , but how many copies should be included? If one, then we have a consistency problem, if two, then that's two cards which are being cut out for something that, in my opinion, is not crucial.

     I've tried many times to make it work, but it ended up being too situational. In order to profit from its full effect, you'll have to draw it, be at the same location as your co-op partner, and they would need to resolve a
     <span class="icon-willpower">
     </span>
     test. It ended up spending most of its time just sitting around in my hand. Ultimately underwhelming, there are better cards to include in the deck.
